-----------------------------------------------------
Java is a platform independent object oriented programming language
Java is WORA: Write once run Anywhere!

Platform Dependency->

Source Code>>>hello.c
Compile>>>Compiler>>>"OS"
Executable code>>>.exe file<< RUN

We get exe file because of combination work of OS and compiler

Win10: 64 bit>>>test.exe<< Win7:32 bit
exe file from Win10,64 bit won't run on win7,32 bit because architecture changes
Plus it will not work on Linux and MAC

platform dependence means exe file is made for a specific platform,machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Interview question->>
1. Is Source code platform Dependent? 
Ans. No, it will run on any platform. 
     Exe file will not run on any platform

2. Then which file is platform dependent?
Ans. exe file is platform dependent
---------------------------------------------------------------
Platform independency--->>

Source code>>hello.java<<<
Compile>>>Compiler>>>
	Byte Code>>> which is a .class file
	"Byte code is intermediate code", cannot be executed,binary code encrypted. Can't be opened in editor

Execute>>>JVM<<<Interpreted
       "OS">>>>>Binary code<<< will not get a .exe file

int x; >>> JVM >>> 4 byte >>> OS
JVM is like agent which interacts with bank(OS)
 
When we execute bytecode on jvm, it will be interpreted and we will not get a .exe file
------------------------------------------------------------
3. Intermediate code --->
Ans. A code which only those who have converted it to can understand
    It is formed by Java compiler. It is formed in form of .class file.
    It is machine independent binary code

4. Do we get a .exe file after executing the bytecode?
Ans. No . It will be directly interpreted in 01 form and executed

5. Which code is platform independent?
Ans. Bytecode

6. Is android a virtual machine?
Ans. Android is a Operating system. It is not JVM.

7. Is code executed on environment of OS?
Ans. Not on OS. 
     Byte code is executed in JVM environment which interacts with OS

8. Is JVM platform dependent?
Ans. Yes. we have to install it depending on platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
jdk(java development kit) Download. It is for development . with jdk, jre comes.

jre (java runtime environment). It is just for executing

9. Diff between JDK and JRE

JDK + JRE
Java SE 8
Java 8 . (Oracle JDK)

x86 means 32 bit system but its java setup will run on 64 bit system also but for 32 bit system, we require x86 only
x64 means 64 bit version

After setup, you will get c:/programfiles/java

See jdk/bin . Here you will get javac and java
javac - compiling
java - executing
_____________________________________________________---
run on cmd->

java -version
javac -version

test.java code->>>

class Demo
{
 public static void main(String [] args)
 {
  System.out.println("Hello Students, How are you");
 }
}

Compilation:
javac test.java

Byte code:
Demo.class (This can be run on any platform)

Execute:
java Demo
