-----------
create database sample1;

create table sample1.student(
 roll int;
 name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
 
 Primary Key (roll)
);


Primary key is unique, cannot be null, never changes
In database ,indexing of rows happen by primary key for faster searching
And it is used to uniquely identify rows.
Also a table can have only 1 primary key

NOT NULL is a constraint so that any field cannot be null
************************************************************

empid 	name	salary	bonus

1	Raj	15000	500
2	Mohan	7000	0
3	Shyam	8000	NULL

Q. Why null is there in bonus?
Ans. Suppose this is record of month
     NULL means no value in it.
    
    In front of Mohan is 0, that means mohan didn't got bonus
    Shyam has NULL doesn't means he didn't got bonus. There may be value missing
    OR shyam doesn't get bonus ever .//That means this particular value is not applicable to Mohan

    Null means no value
*******************************************************************************************

create table sample1.student(
 roll int;
 name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
 phone varchar(12) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 email varchar(100) UNIQUE,
 city varchar(100) default 'indore',
 Primary Key (roll)
);

Phone no. will not repeat,
so make it unique by UNIQUE Constraint.

email can be missing and is unique

**So there can be more than 1 unique keys in a table
  And unique can accept NULL or NOT NULL
  but primary key is always NOT  NULL

Phone cannot be primary key
*********************************************************************
**default means if value not supplied, it get's default value

Database Normalization
**********************************************

1NF: Atomic Values
     phone :985874858,748595879

     This is because database won't be able to search 985874858 because in database there is 985874858,7485958749
     In delete, also we will have search problem
     Also in update, suppose if we want to change phone no. , both phone no.s will be replaced by 1 phone no. Which is wrong

2NF: Must be 1 NF
     All columns must be dependent on primary key

     Our table should have only those columns which are dependent on that roll no.
     
  Q:   What is problem with city field?
  Ans. 
         Suppose there are 10,00,00,000 Records are there
         And we want to find ujjain city students,
         select* from student where city="ujjain";
         So database has to search 10 crore records 
         
         Now main primary columns do not have indexing

         Now suppose we had state and pincode field,
         then we had lot of MP, Bhopal, pincodes written
         So this leads to lot of duplicacy. 
         
         So we can make separate table for managing all this data. 
         This is 2 NF concept

create table sample1.city
(
 pincode int,
 cityname varchar(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 PRIMARY KEY(pincode)
);
  
And we do changes in student table

create table student
(
 city int,
 PRIMARY KEY(roll),'
 FOREIGN KEY(city) REFERENCES sample1.city(pincode)
);

So we made a foreign key in student like this


So this will give us advantages.
we will not have redundant data, 
we will be able to search faster because city will be searched by primary key


Ex. Suppose there is a shop owner 1
    Now he has a single big place to keep stock of goods
    
    Another shop owner 2,
    He kept the data in multiple small places(10 Rooms)

    Now in Room1, we can't search different items faster

    In Room2 also will be difficult,
    but he has managed a Book
    like 1. Kirana Room1
        2. Milk Room2
        3. Veg and Fruit Room3

     Room1 ::: 1. tea: column 12
               2. sugar:column 33
  
    For example, library manages books in separate location and it is very easy to search a 
      particular branch, particular semester and particular subject book

***************************************************************************************************
Q. Now write SQL Query to search for ujjain city

Ans. select * from student where city in
     (select pincode from city where cityname="Ujjain")

    This is called subquery or nested queries
      
    This will bring us pincode of ujjain city
    And that pincode will be used to search

   ------------------
   But we have to use join query
   
   Select * 
   from student inner join sample1.city
   on student.city = city.pincode
   where city.cityname='ujjain';
   
   Here we can fetch both student and city details
***************************************************************************************************
Let's come back to old table

create table sample1.student(
 roll int;
 name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
 phone varchar(12) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 email varchar(100) UNIQUE,
 city varchar(100) default 'indore',
 Primary Key (roll)
);

//Insert data//

insert into sample1.student 
value
(101,'Gopal','9874857484','gopal@abcd.com','ujjain');

But this data have to be in sequence according to table

Now if we want not to give all column values

insert into sample1.student
value
(102,'Mahesh','7845814578','dewas');

This will give error because table have 5 columns
So we have to mention column names

insert into sample1.student
(roll,name,phone,city)
value
(102,'Mahesh','7845814578','dewas');

This will do the work
***********************************************
We can have sequence of columns different if we mention columns

insert into sample1.student
(roll,name,phone)
value
(102,'Mahesh','7845814578');

default indore got written

**************************************************************************************
//update

update sample1.student 
set name="Anuj",email="anuj@abcd.com";

This will give error as email id is unique,
so it will change 1 row ,
then it will give error in other rows because email id got entered

But if uniqye constraint won't be there,
all values have got changed

update sample1.student 
set name="Anuj",email="anuj@abcd.com"
where rollno=110;

This will change only 1 row or record

**************************************************************************************
delete from sample1.student;

//This deletes all the records

delete from sample1.student where city='dewas';

//This deletes a particular record

delete from sample1.student
where city='dewas' or city='ujjain';

***********************************************************************************
//For fetching all the records
select * from students;

* means projection which means all columns
We can change projection like enter roll,name,city

select roll,name,city from student;
//all records, selectable columns

Use limit to view limited rows

select * from student where city="ujjain";
//selected records, all columns

select roll,name,city from student
where city="ujjain";
//selected records, selectable columns

So using where clause, we can do selection

**********************************************************
select * from student where age>23;

select *from student 
where age>23 and city='dewas';

select * from student
where city='ujjain' or city='dewas';

or we can do

select * from student
where city in ('ujjain','dewas',bhopal');
//to get student from this cities

select * from student
where city not in ('ujjain','dewas',bhopal');
//to get student except this cities

select *from student
where age>21 and age<35;

select *from student
where age between 103 and 107;
//inclusive records
******************************************************************
select * from student order by name; //ascending order

select * from student order by name DESC; //descending order

select * from student order by name,city;
//first sort by name, if same names, then sort by city
