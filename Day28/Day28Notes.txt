we went to glassfish local server

localhost:4848/commmon/index.jsf

Now click on deploy,
it will ask to browse WAR file

Then we entered context root /eshop

Then we clicked okay.
Now WAR file got deployed to application server

Now we can directly type in browser localhost:8080/eshop/web/login.html

We used Netbeans to only start glassfish but our project is running without netbeans

******************************************************************************************
Now we want to keep this application  on a remote server so it can be visible to everyone

We uploaded the WAR file and mysql file on our email

aws.amazon.com
----------------

We go to EC2
We go to Instances

We have prepared a VM of windows server (free machine)

We will start the machine

So we get its IP address
And it changes each time, we start the machine

So in Linux, there is a Remmina remote desktop
So sir entered the details and connect to the AWS window machine

So in cmd,
check there is java
but we did not have to development,
so we installed only JRE, not JDK

So we went on browser and went to download Android Studio

It gets downloaded in 1 minute, because it is getting internet in Amazon

Now we will open up our email here to get the WAR file and sql file

Download the files
We installed the XAMP here

We started the Apache from XAMP control panel
We can fix here the port number of MySQL file by my.ini file

Start the Mysql server also

We opened mysql on cmd,
and copy pasted one by one commands from project.sql here

We set the path of xammp mysql
Then do mysql -u root -p

Then enter the table commands

Download the apache tomcat

On writing on browser, "localhost",
apache server will open up

So if we write 54.237.24.132:80
,then it will open up apache on our browser also

We login to apache
And then we entered the WAR file

Now we entered the WAR file path
It is not working
**************************************************************
Let's try using XAMMP tomcat server,
start it

We go to /tomcat-user.xml

and set its configuration by setting its username and password
********************************************************************
So what problem was happening was
we made the WAR file using glassfish server

So we have to change glassfish-web.xml to context.xml
and change the code inside it
